Things to note:

Move the mouse around to match the frequency listed at the bottom. You have to press "f" quickly after you find the 
frequency otherwise the amplitude will decay and you'll have to relocate the frequency. The way it checks if you got the right frequency
is it checks the energy of that particular frequency once you press f but the energy will decay over time so you need to press f within
a certain time limit of dragging your mouse over the target frequency. 

If you want to hear the frequency you're aiming to match press "r". There is also a visual cue: the FFT will become fully green once you
are at the correct frequency and red when you are in the wrong spot.

After 8 incorrect guesses, it's a game over and you need to refresh the page to play again. 

Main controls: drag mouse to match frequency. Press "f" after you think you've matched the frequency.
Press "r" to hear the frequency you're trying to match again. Once you get the frequency correct, you will be given a new frequency to aim for.

The main idea was to make a game that trained your ability to hear and match a certain pitch.
